# Identification-of-Market-Profiles-Via-Time-Series-Analysis

The research conducted an in-depth analysis of the price relationships among various telecommunications product companies in Chile to identify distinct market profiles, including reactive, proactive, and passive. The study utilized statistical methods such as Cross-Correlation Funtion (CCF), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and Instantaneous Phase Synchronization (IPS) to examine the price behaviour patterns over time. In addition, an unsupervised cluster analysis technique was employed to categorize products based on similar price dynamics. The comparison between the two entities revealed that DTW and IPS techniques can complement each other in specific contexts. Despite its limitations, this work significantly contributes to the existing knowledge base and provides valuable insights into price dynamics and competitive behaviour within the studied markets. The research successfully identified distinct market profiles for the two companies under study by combining the results of all the techniques used. The zenPriceT M platform created by Ritain.io is a SaaS solution that collects, via web-scrapping, the prices of various products on the e-commerce market and then makes them available via a centralised platform to its customers, who are generally companies that also sell this type of product. The methods explored in this dissertation are valuable for enhancing the functionality of this platform.

The project presented in this dissertation was carried out at the Aveiro Institute of Electronic and Computer Engineering (IEETA) of the University of Aveiro. The main objective is to study market profiles using data provided by Ritain.io using methods such as CCF, DTW and IPS.
